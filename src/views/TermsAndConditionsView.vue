                provides for the immediate suspension and/or termination of the
                Site or the Service user who is found to have infringed on the
                rights of the Company or of a third party, or otherwise violated
                any intellectual property laws or regulations. The Company's
                policy is to investigate any allegations of copyright
                infringement brought to its attention. If you have evidence,

                infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to
                have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are
                covered by a single notification, a representative list of such
                works; (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be
                infringed or to be the subject of infringing activity and that
                is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and
                information reasonably sufficient to permit the Company to
                locate the material; (d) information reasonably sufficient to
                permit the Company to contact you, such as an address, telephone
                number, and if available, an electronic mail address at which
                you may be contacted; (e) a statement that you have a good faith
